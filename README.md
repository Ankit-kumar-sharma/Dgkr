#I have developed the frontend part of this website with the help of the react js and backend using nodejs.

#In the website user has two options to store the data either in the local storage of own system which he/she can see or in the firebase it's up to the user.

#I have add one more functionality if user store the data in localstorage then After the submission of the input fields one 'show' button will be appear by clicking the button user can see the stored data.

#thank you 'Datagrokr'.
